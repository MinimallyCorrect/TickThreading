Compatibility with other mods
-----
[See the wiki.](https://github.com/nallar/TickThreading/wiki/Mod-Compatibility)

Configuration
-----
TickThreading uses minecraft forge's suggested config location - minecraft folder/configs/TickThreading.cfg
Some additional configuration options which need to be set before the server is started can be changed in the ttlaunch.properties file in your server folder.
It's commented quite well, and is hopefully understandable. If any of the descriptions don't make sense please make an issue.

Logging
-----
TickThreading stores its logs in the TickThreadingLogs directory, and will keep the previous 5 logs.
Make sure to include all relevant logs if you run into a problem.
